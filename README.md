# airflow-utils

Apache Airflow has become the de facto standard for Data Orchestration. However, throughout the years and versions, it accumulated a set of nuances and bugs which can hinder its production usage.

This package aims at creating a centralized source of tools to overcome some of the limitations found in Airflow and to extend some of its features.
